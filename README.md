🌍 Earthquake Data Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end earthquake data pipeline using AWS services (Lambda + Glue) to ingest, transform, and analyze earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API
.

📌 Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

Data Ingestion (Lambda)

Fetches earthquake data (past 1 year) from the USGS API in GeoJSON format.

Saves the raw data locally or to S3 as .json.

Data Transformation (Glue – PySpark)

Converts raw JSON data into a clean tabular format with the following fields:

time (human-readable datetime)

place

magnitude

longitude, latitude, depth

type (event type)

Saves results as CSV or Parquet.

Data Analysis (Glue – PySpark)

Calculates average magnitude per day.

Identifies the Top 10 largest earthquakes.

Counts earthquakes per country/region (parsed from the place string).

Sample analysis results are included in the /output/ folder.

Output

Final results are saved in the /output/ folder.

🚀 How to Run
1. Prerequisites

AWS account with permissions for Lambda, Glue, and S3.

Python 3.9+ (for running scripts locally if needed).

Optional: Virtual environment (python -m venv venv) and install dependencies from requirements.txt.

2. Data Ingestion (Lambda)

Navigate to the lambda/ folder.

Deploy ingest_lambda.py to AWS Lambda.

Configure the Lambda function to run manually or on a schedule (e.g., via CloudWatch Events).

The raw earthquake JSON data will be saved to S3 or locally.

3. Data Transformation (Glue)

Upload glue/transform.py to AWS Glue as a job script.

Point the job to the raw JSON data location (S3).

Run the Glue job → produces a transformed dataset in CSV/Parquet format.

4. Data Analysis (Glue)

Upload glue/analyze.py to AWS Glue as a job script.

Run the job → generates the following outputs in /output/:

Average magnitude per day

Top 10 largest earthquakes

Earthquake counts per region

📊 Sample Outputs

avg_magnitude_per_day.csv → Trends of earthquake intensity over time.

top10_earthquakes.csv → Largest earthquakes by magnitude.

earthquakes_per_region.csv → Geographical distribution of earthquakes.

📝 Notes

Large datasets are not included; they can be regenerated by running the pipeline.

Sample outputs are provided to illustrate expected results.

Ensure AWS IAM roles have sufficient permissions for S3, Lambda, and Glue jobs.
